/*
    The are two special types of selectors, class selectors and id selectors.
        >> The two have a similarity between them and that is
            if you explicitly define the style for a particular tag with tag selectors and class/id
            selectors, then the tag selector is overwritten by the class/id selectors.
        >> The difference is that while defining, class is defined with a "." and id with a "#"
        >> The next difference is, with id selectors you can define only one instance of it, while
            for class, you may create as many instances you want.
        >> The next is that you can have more than 1 class for a particular element but only 1 id.
